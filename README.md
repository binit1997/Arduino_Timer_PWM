# PWM using Timer 2 of atmega328p 

   The Atmel® picoPower® ATmega328/P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR® enhanced RISC architecture.
   Timer/Counter2 (TC2) is a general purpose, channel, 8-bit Timer/Counter module.
   The fast Pulse Width Modulation or fast PWM mode provides a high frequency PWM waveform generation option.
   A 7.8khz signal is generated at pin 11 using timer 2.
   The duty cycle can be varied from 0% to 100%.
